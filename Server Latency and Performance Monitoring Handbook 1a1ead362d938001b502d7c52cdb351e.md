# Server Latency and Performance Monitoring Handbook

## **What is Latency?**

Latency refers to the time taken for a server to respond to a request, typically measured in milliseconds (**ms**). Lower latency means faster responses, while higher latency indicates delays in processing requests.

## **Why Monitoring Latency is Important**

### **1. User Experience**

High latency means slower response times, leading to poor user experience, frustrated customers, and potential revenue loss for businesses.

### **2. Performance Optimization**

Latency is a key metric for understanding how well a server is performing. If latency is consistently high, it signals an underlying issue that needs investigation.

### **3. Troubleshooting Issues**

Latency acts as an early warning system for server issues. Once high latency is detected, other metrics can be analyzed to find the root cause.

## **How Latency Relates to Other Server Metrics**

When latency increases, it’s crucial to check the following:

- **High CPU Usage?** → The server might be overloaded, causing processing delays.
- **High Memory Usage or Swap Usage?** → Memory bottlenecks could slow down performance.
- **High Disk Read/Write Ops?** → Slow disk I/O might be causing delays in retrieving data.
- **High DB Queries per Second?** → The database could be under heavy load, leading to longer response times.
- **High Network In/Out?** → A DDoS attack or large data transfers could be affecting response times.

By monitoring latency first, you quickly detect performance issues, then use other metrics to diagnose and resolve them efficiently.
