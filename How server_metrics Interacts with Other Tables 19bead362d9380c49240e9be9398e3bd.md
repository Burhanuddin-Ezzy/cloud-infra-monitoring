# How server_metrics Interacts with Other Tables

### **1. `error_logs` (Tracking Performance Issues and Failures)**

- **Interaction**: `server_metrics` generates entries in `error_logs` when anomalies occur, such as spikes in CPU, memory, or disk usage.
- **Scenarios**:
    - **High CPU Load** – If `cpu_usage > 90%` for more than 5 minutes, an entry is logged in `error_logs` (`error_type = HIGH_CPU_USAGE`).
    - **Memory Leaks** – If `memory_usage` continuously increases without dropping, an `error_logs` entry is created.
    - **Disk Bottlenecks** – If `disk_read_ops_per_sec` and `disk_write_ops_per_sec` exceed limits, the system logs disk performance issues.
    - **Network Failures** – If `network_in_bytes` or `network_out_bytes` suddenly drop to 0 while uptime is still increasing, a connectivity error is logged.
    - **Database Query Failures** – If `db_queries_per_sec = 0` despite high app activity, it may indicate a database issue.

### **2. `downtime_logs` (Tracking Server Availability)**

- **Interaction**: If `uptime_in_mins = 0`, a downtime entry is created in `downtime_logs`, capturing the affected server, timestamp, and possible cause.
- **Scenarios**:
    - **Unexpected Reboots** – If `uptime_in_mins` resets from a large number (e.g., 43200 minutes) to `1`, the ystem logs a **reboot event**.
    - **Total System Failure** – If `cpu_usage = 0`, `network_in_bytes = 0`, and `uptime_in_mins = 0`, a complete shutdown is logged.
    - **Network Issues** – If `network_in_bytes = 0` but `cpu_usage` remains high, a network-related downtime event is logged.
    - **Storage Failure** – If `disk_read_ops_per_sec = 0` and `disk_write_ops_per_sec = 0` while CPU is high, it suggests a disk failure.

### **3. `resource_allocation` (Auto-Scaling and Load Balancing)**

- **Interaction**: If resource utilization crosses predefined limits, `server_metrics` informs `resource_allocation` to adjust compute, memory, or storage resources.
- **Scenarios**:
    - **Auto-Scaling Triggered** – If `cpu_usage > 85%` for an extended period, `resource_allocation` provisions more compute resources.
    - **Memory Overload** – If `memory_usage > 90%`, more RAM may be allocated or workloads migrated.
    - **Disk Overload** – If `disk_write_ops_per_sec` remains high, more storage resources may be assigned.
    - **Network Bottleneck** – If `network_in_bytes` exceeds bandwidth limits, traffic is rerouted or network capacity is increased.

### **4. `cost_data` (Tracking Cloud Billing and Resource Usage)**

- **Interaction**: Resource consumption data (`cpu_usage`, `memory_usage`, `disk_read_ops_per_sec`, etc.) directly influence cloud costs.
- **Scenarios**:
    - **Compute Costs** – High `cpu_usage` for extended periods increases cloud compute expenses.
    - **Storage Costs** – Frequent high `disk_write_ops_per_sec` leads to additional storage charges.
    - **Bandwidth Costs** – If `network_out_bytes` exceeds provider limits, extra data transfer fees apply.
    - **Cost Optimization** – Underutilized servers (`cpu_usage < 10%`) may be flagged for shutdown to reduce costs.

### **5. `alert_history` (Logging Alerts for Performance Anomalies)**

- **Interaction**: If `server_metrics` exceeds a threshold, an entry is added to `alert_history` for review.
- **Scenarios**:
    - **Critical CPU Alert** – If `cpu_usage > 95%`, an alert is recorded.
    - **High Latency** – If `latency_in_ms > 5000`, an alert is logged.
    - **Network Congestion** – If `network_in_bytes` increases drastically, a DDoS attack alert is triggered.
    - **Disk Failure Warning** – If `disk_read_ops_per_sec = 0` for a busy disk, an alert is logged.

### **6. `aggregated_metrics` (Summarizing Data for Reporting & Trends)**

- **Interaction**: `server_metrics` data is aggregated in `aggregated_metrics` for long-term analysis.
- **Scenarios**:
    - **Weekly CPU Trends** – Average `cpu_usage` over a week is stored for reporting.
    - **Peak Memory Usage Analysis** – Max `memory_usage` per hour is recorded.
    - **Storage Performance Insights** – `disk_read_ops_per_sec` and `disk_write_ops_per_sec` are averaged per day.
    - **Network Traffic Patterns** – Summarized daily traffic (`network_in_bytes`, `network_out_bytes`) helps optimize bandwidth.

### **7. `application_logs` (Correlating Server Performance with App Behavior)**

- **Interaction**: `server_metrics` helps correlate server performance with application-level logs.
- **Scenarios**:
    - **Slow Response Time Investigation** – If `latency_in_ms > 3000`, `application_logs` can be checked for slow queries.
    - **Memory Usage Correlation** – If `memory_usage` spikes after new code deployment, it may indicate a memory leak.
    - **CPU Spikes Due to Heavy Processing** – If `cpu_usage > 90%` and logs show heavy computations, inefficient code may be the cause.

### **8. `user_access_logs` (Monitoring Performance vs. User Activity)**

- **Interaction**: User activity impacts server metrics like CPU and network usage.
- **Scenarios**:
    - **Traffic Spikes & CPU Load** – A sudden increase in logins aligns with high `cpu_usage`.
    - **DDoS Attack Detection** – If `network_in_bytes` is abnormally high but user activity is low, a DDoS attack is suspected.
    - **Slow Login Investigation** – If `latency_in_ms > 5000` during peak login times, a bottleneck is detected.

### **9. `alerts_configuration` (Defining Thresholds for Alerts)**

- **Interaction**: `server_metrics` is monitored against thresholds defined in `alerts_configuration`.
- **Scenarios**:
    - **Custom CPU Alert Thresholds** – If an admin sets `cpu_usage > 80%`, alerts are triggered accordingly.
    - **Latency Alert Configuration** – If `latency_in_ms > 2000` is alert-worthy, an entry is added to `alert_history`.
    - **Dynamic Threshold Adjustments** – If `alerts_configuration` updates a threshold, the alerting mechanism adapts.

### **10. `team_management` (Assigning Incidents and Alerts to Teams)**

- **Interaction**: `server_metrics` helps route incidents to appropriate teams.
- **Scenarios**:
    - **Database Issues Routed to DBA Team** – If `db_queries_per_sec = 0`, the database team is notified.
    - **Network Issues Routed to Networking Team** – If `network_in_bytes = 0`, the networking team is alerted.
    - **Application Performance Issues Assigned to Developers** – If `latency_in_ms` is high, the backend team investigates.

### **11. `incident_response_logs` (Tracking Incident Resolution)**

- **Interaction**: If an alert from `server_metrics` leads to an incident, its resolution details are stored in `incident_response_logs`.
- **Scenarios**:
    - **Root Cause Analysis for Downtime** – If `uptime_in_mins = 0`, an incident is logged and updated upon resolution.
    - **Performance Tuning Actions** – If `cpu_usage > 90%` and a solution is applied (e.g., "Scaled up server"), it is logged.
    - **Incident Closure Verification** – Once `server_metrics` returns to normal levels, the incident is marked as resolved.
